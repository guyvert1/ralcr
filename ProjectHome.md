**MOVED TO GITHUB:** https://github.com/ralcr/sdk.ralcr



**_sdk.ralcr_** is a framework for development of web, native mobile and desktop applications in Haxe.

**Targets:**
  1. Flash
  1. HTML5
  1. NME (which includes Flash, HTML5, Mac, iPhone, Android, Windows...)

Flash and HTML5 applications are slightly different than the ones created by NME. In NME, assets are embeded in the swf and you can work with them in a sync way. However, this framework introduces a small delay in order to work with them in an async way and keep the same code.


**Packages:**

  1. **CoreAnimation** - Animation engine: move, scale, zoom, colors, callFunc, sound, text, frames...
  1. **DrawKit** - rectangle, ellipse, line, dashed line, wedge, polygon, gradient, arc, star, noise, random shapes
  1. **Events** - Signal driven events and NotificationCenter
  1. **Foundation** - AppDelegate, font manager, assets manager, data type tools, localization, shared objects, HXAddress, point, size, rect
  1. **IOKit** - Writer for jpg, png and wav
  1. **MediaKit** - Load images, audio, radio stream, video, rtmp video stream
  1. **Network** - Make http requests, load external files, send mail, external lib loader
  1. **Physics** - No need for one, but would be nice to have something in the future.
  1. **Services** - Connect to external services like: flickr, youtube (flash only)
  1. **Skins** - Skins for button, slider, tabbarcontroller, scrollbar. (Haxe, iOS, and possibly android)
  1. **Samples** - Some usage samples for you to understand the components easily.
